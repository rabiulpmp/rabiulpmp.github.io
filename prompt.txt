You are an expert full-stack web developer. Your task is to generate a complete personal portfolio website following the requirements in prd.txt (strictly follow all points mentioned there, including tech stack, UI components, and best practices).

Generate a complete personal portfolio website strictly following all requirements and tech stack mentioned in prd.txt, using the site [https://exillcodex.netlify.app/template/](https://exillcodex.netlify.app/template/) as the primary UI and design reference for layout, responsiveness, animations, and modern minimal style, and integrating all information from resume.pdf and coverletter.pdf including personal details, contact info, title, work experience, projects, education, achievements, skills (shown as a visually appealing skills cloud or tags section), and any other relevant sections; ensure the site is fully responsive, accessible, SEO-friendly, and includes animations, transitions, and interactions as required, with clean modular production-ready code, all deliverables (frontend and backend if specified), deployment-ready structure, and a README.md with setup, build, and deployment instructions. I will deploy it in github page. Use copywrite free image from online if needed.
